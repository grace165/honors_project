                    A successful business plan is critical to the startup of a new business. In order to create a
                    successful business plan,
                    you have to focus on the details. List as many details about the processes and procedures that will
                    keep your business alive and sustainable.
                    I have created a <a class="link3" href="../businessSetup/tutorials.html">video tutorial</a> that
                    walks you through the creation of a thorough business plan.
                    In the tutorial, I also follow a business model provided by the Valley SBDC that can be found <a

                    Hopefully, you were able to get information regarding the necessary permits and licenses you need.
                    You will need to ask
                    Community Development for zoning certification and what the cost will be. Also, ask the Commissioner
                    of Revenues Office about
                    business license requirements. While you can find information online, this info can be outdated or
                    be missing information.
                    To avoid unwanted trips to the center, begin by visiting for information. Some example questions
                    include&#58 What papers are needed to file for a zoning permit?
                    What type of zoning permit do I need? What do I need to file for a business license? What is the

                <p>Now that you have filed with the SCC and received your FEIN, you can finally apply for your zoning

                    You will need to go in-person to complete the application. Community Development will be able to
                    tell you which zoning permit you should
                    apply for based on your unique business situation. Hopefully, you had visited them beforehand (in
                    step #6) and know which forms to bring and what permit you are filing for.

                    For Graphics Gremlin LLC, I will be working from my home office. In this case, I needed to fill out
                    a &#8220Home Occupation&#8221 Permit.
                    If you work out of a physical storefront, you will need to file for a different permit. Either way,
                    Community Development will be able to tell you which form you need to be applying for.

                    Make sure to bring your FEIN verification and zoning permit. The process for the business
