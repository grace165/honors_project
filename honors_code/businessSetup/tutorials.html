                <p> Hello! My name is Grace, and this is my tutorial on how to write a successful business plan. After
                    this tutorial, you will be able to write a clear, readable business plan that outlines what your
                    plan is for your small business&#39s future. I&#39ll start by walking through what you need in order
                    to setup your business plan, and then we&#39ll jump into the specifics of what needs to be clearly
                    addressed in your plan. Let&#39s get started!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, before writing your business plan, there are 10 things that you need to consider. These
                    questions will help guide your thoughts and understanding of what is necessary when thinking of the
                    long-term outlook for your business. This list can be found at the valley small business development
                    center website, and I have attached the link to this slide and will put it in the description down
                    below. So, to start, you have to begin thinking about what your product will look like. What product
                    are you providing? What is the need? Is it solving a problem? Who is your market? And why will
                    people want to buy it? And these questions are just here to get you thinking about what you will do
                    with your product and what profit will be needed to have a sustainable business. So I&#39d consider
                    going through these once or twice and just getting the details out before starting your actual
                    business plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, we will discuss some more basic needs for your business plan. First, I am sure that you have
                    thought about what you will name your business, but have you checked with the State Corporation
                    Commission? This site will show you the availability for business names, and remember that there are
                    certain naming conventions and rules also listed on this site. For example, all Limited Liability
                    Companies need to have LLC somewhere in their name. And then you can also register for a fictitious
                    name from there if you want to. The second thing you need to have ready for your business plan is
                    your market research and who is going to be your target market. This will lead you to your initial
                    setup costs and your considerations and options for financing. Also, make sure to have contacts
                    ready for who your team is going to be when running your business. Who is managing bookkeeping? Are
                    you hiring an attorney? Et cetera. Finally, think about the location of your business&#8211either a
                    physical storefront or online. You will need to file for a zoning application no matter where
                    you&#39re going to be working from, even if you are working from home and have an online business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With those initial startup necessities filled out, you can also access other resources that will
                    help you fill in your business plan. The Valley SBDC has a growth wheel model that I follow for the
                    rest of this tutorial as well as financial worksheets and excel spreadsheets that are fill in the
                    blank for your business costs and beginning investments. They also have useful checklists for what
                    you need in your beginning stages of starting your small business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally! Let&#39s fill out our business plan! Gather all your resources we&#39ve been collecting and
                    focus on being descriptive and thorough. Remember, a good business plan is key to starting a
                    successful small business. Let&#39s get into it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, here I am going to be using an example of a business plan outline that is available at the
                    Valley SBDC website that I had mentioned earlier and I&#39ll link in the description. So, on this
                    front page here, for the business plan, you are going to fill in simple general personal
                    information. Add who the owner of the business is, the address for the business, the date, and
                    general contact information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the second page, focus on the details for these specific sections. The executive summary is where
                    you are going to put your goals and mission statements for your business. This is actually going to
                    be written last. So after you go through the business plan, you&#39ll come back up here. And it&#39s
                    kind of like a summary of everything else you&#39ve written in these next couple pages. Then focus
                    on the business concept. That&#39s where you&#39re going to describe your product info and customer
                    info. Again linking to those target markets and market research that we&#39ve been collecting for
                    your business plan. You&#39ll think about the organization for your business, that includes the
                    ownership and also information for having employees, if you are going to have any.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moving on to the third page, you&#39ll go over again more details with the organization
                    here&#8211talking about potential partnerships, allies, and suppliers&#8211who you are going to be
                    working with in the community and get your resources from. Then we are going to start talking about
                    your business processes and that&#39s how you&#39ll go about your daily tasks. And then move on to
                    customer relations&#8211who are you networking with? How is your marketing going to work? Etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, on the fourth page, you&#39ll finish discussing your marketing with details about your
                    branding and communications with PR...Talk about what social media accounts you are going to have, if
                    you&#39re going to use radio, television, etc. And then move on to operations where you&#39ll
                    discuss the details with financials like we discussed earlier with if you&#39re going to get any
                    loans, discuss the funding in general, production, deliveries, how are you going to make that work,
                    IT systems…and that sums up the fourth page for the business plan!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, this fifth page is optional. It&#39s listed as the appendix where you can attach pages that
                    will be useful after you&#39ve just gone through and listed the details for your business&#39s
                    functions, product information, and processes. I would recommend if you&#39ve got a physical
                    storefront location already picked out that you list the blueprints for floorplans. On here it lists
                    menus&#8211perhaps if you&#39re starting a small restaurant. I know that when I went through this
                    process I made sure to add a startup cost worksheet and that can also be found in an Excel
                    spreadsheet given to you by the Valley SBDC if you go to that resources tab that I discussed
                    earlier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, I just want to say it one more time&#8211 &#8220A good business plan sets the tone
                    for the rest of the startup process.&#8221 If you are able to write a good business plan, that will
                    be a strong foundation for the rest of your startup process. At the beginning of setting up a small
                    business it can be a bit daunting, but if you have a strong foundation from the get&#8211go, you
                    have a strong plan, you know where your business is going to go in the future, you have the
                    necessary resources to make that happen&#8211it’s going to be a much easier process for you. So,
                    hopefully, by the end of this video, you&#39ve been able to follow through with the tutorial and
                    gained some insight and necessary assets that you need in order to write your own business plan. I
                    would suggest going to your local SBDC or check the Valley SBDC link that I&#39ve put in this video
                    and in the description. And from there you&#39ll be able to fill out that model for the business
                    plan or you can write your own. Thank you!

                <p>Hello! My name is Grace, and welcome back to another one of my small business setup tutorials! Today,
                    we will be discussing the official beginnings of your business&#8211filing with the State
                    Corporation Commission! This video will help guide you through the steps needed to set up your
                    information and file for your articles of organization. Let&#39s get started!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In today&#39s video, we will cover how to create a login, checking availability of business names,
                    and upload or file for the articles of organization. This example is also done through the SCC site
                    for Virginia and is done for an LLC creation. I have also linked the SCC site to this page here, and
                    I will put it in the description below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, we will discuss the part I had the most trouble with&#8211setting up your SCC account!
                </p>
                <p>
                    To start, load up the SCC site and find the section asking you to sign in. It is the column located
                    all the way to the left and asks for a username and password. Since we are just starting out, we are
                    only going to hit the Green &#8220Register&#8221 button. This will take you to a page asking you to
                    fill out all of your personal information! You can read through the terms and conditions, and then
                    choose a username and password and write them down somewhere safe! You will also want to make sure
                    you are using your personal address, not the address for the business. You want to keep your account
                    information in case you need to change your address in the future. After filling in your personal
                    info, you will hit the &#8220submit&#8221 button at the bottom of the page and it should send a code
                    to your phone. Now, this is where I had issues. I could not get the code sent to my phone for some
                    reason and had to email the SCC to receive a temporary code. Once I had received the temporary code,
                    I also had issues because they could not validate my identity with their system. Instead, I had to
                    fill out an Account Help Request Form, which we will go over next.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you need to go to this step, this page will again ask for your personal information in creating
                    your account. It says that they will only accept certain bills that provide your name and address,
                    but I submitted a picture of the front of my driver&#39s license and got my account created that
                    way. After uploading your image or pdf file and submitting, it will take a day or 2 for them to
                    create your account for you, but you will be set from there! (you will receive an email saying your
                    account was setup given the username and password you provided in this form). If you were able to
                    take the regular route and submit that way, you are also ready to use your account information and
                    sign in, which is our next step!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, we move past the creation of your account to after you have signed in and are ready to
                    navigate the dashboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once signed in, you will open up to your Dashboard view. Here, you can see there are many things
                    that you can access and do through your SCC account. Don&#39t get too overwhelmed&#8211we are only
                    looking for the &#8220Online Services&#8221 tab at the top.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, on the &#8220Online Services&#8221 page, we are going to click on the &#8220New
                    Businesses&#8221 link under &#8220Business Entities&#8221 at the top. This is how you are going to
                    file for your articles of organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    OK, we have successfully navigated to the creation of our new articles of organization, let&#39s get
                    started! This is what will take the most time to complete. It is best to get it done all at once,
                    but there are options to access the filings again if you need to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After clicking on the New Businesses link, we will be taken to the creating a business page. Here we
                    will file for the Virginia Entity and select our business type. For this example, we will be
                    choosing the Limited Liability Company or LLC. When choosing your business type, remember to do your
                    research to find which type is best for you. Once you select the LLC type, another box comes up
                    asking for the filing type—the options are Articles of Organization or Articles of Organization for
                    a Professional LLC. Only choose the professional one if you are a recognized professional with
                    certain certifications…then hit continue at the bottom of the form to move to the next Step!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, it&#39s finally time to check the availability of your business name! By now you should have
                    checked your name on the SCC site following the steps on my website and can enter it now and check
                    for the availability of that name…Note, that Certain words and abbreviations are necessary for
                    business types (for example, limited liability companies need to have an &#8220LLC&#8221
                    abbreviation in their registration). You can check at this link listed on the slide, and I will put
                    it in the description below, for the necessary pieces needed for your business name. Once you&#39ve
                    chosen a name, hit next, and the system will let you continue if your name is available and fits the
                    necessary requirements. Another note is that you can reserve a name if you cannot file all at once
                    and are worried about saving the name, but it costs $10 and the SCC does not recommend doing this.
                    It&#39s easier to file all at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the next step, you&#39ll need to enter your information again and choose the duration of the
                    business. In general, choose perpetual (forever) and you can close at any time. You also need an
                    industry code if you apply to any of those&#8211for a general business type, like ours, leave it as
                    general. If you are an insurance or mortgage company or a religious group, then you will need to
                    choose an industry code that applies to you. Once you have double checked every box, hit next at the
                    bottom of the page to continue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are a registered agent or have someone else acting as yours, then here is the step for you to
                    organize that! If you need help, I have included the link for more information on this slide and in
                    the description. As manager and owner of the LLC, I can be my own registered agent. Hit the
                    &#8220Create Individual RA&#8221 button. You&#39ll fill in my personal information again and it will
                    verify the address! You will want to pick the RA capacity that works for your title—for me, I picked
                    the member or manager of the LLC, but there are other options that are more specific. Hit the
                    checkbox indicating the individual is a resident of VA, and continue with the next button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the next step, you will need to list the information for the address of your principal office.
                    Where will your business be doing business? For me, I have a graphic design business based out of my
                    home, so I&#39ll use my personal home address. If you have an online business working out of your
                    home, you can do the same. Else, use your physical storefront or main office address. Hit next when
                    you are finished!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This next step is simple. It is not required and will only be listed in the articles of organization
                    for your business. You can choose to add a structure for your business and choose of the only 2
                    options—manager managed or member managed. I chose to leave this blank. Once you are done with this
                    decision, hit next.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, you have the opportunity if you choose to upload a document that will be acting as your
                    articles of organization. This upload requires a review time period and will delay your approval. If
                    you choose to do so, click the checkbox and hit the green &#8220Attach&#8221 button to add your PDF
                    uploads (they only accept PDFs with a maximum size of 50MB, but you can upload multiple attachments
                    if you need to). I also skipped this step. When you are ready, hit the next button to move on!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we reach the signatures. Here, you simply type the name of the organizer (in this case your
                    name if you are filing as an individual) and fill in your first and last name as well. Then hit the
                    &#8220Add&#8221. You can edit these or delete them as well. And when you are done, hit next.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are almost there! Now, you have the chance to review all of the information that you have added
                    thus far. You can edit anything you need, but take the time to double check everything is correct
                    and that you left nothing blank. When it&#39s completed to your liking, you will hit &#8220Add to
                    Shopping Cart&#8221 at the bottom of the screen. This will take you to a checkout window and you can
                    continue with the checkout button to the payment window from there. The cost is $100, but after
                    that, you will receive your articles of organization and certificate for your LLC. Yay!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Woo! You did it! The process of filing with the SCC can seem scary and tedious, but this is the
                    exciting official start of your new small business! It is best to sit down and get this done all at
                    once to ensure there are no errors in the system, but it should not take any longer than 30 minutes
                    while reading all text boxes for ensuring correct inputs and information. Hopefully, after following
                    this tutorial, you will feel confident about filing and get your new business officially started!
                    Thank you for watching!

                <p>Hello! My name is Grace, and this is yet another tutorial in my series for starting a small business.
                    Today, we will be talking about how to obtain your FEIN or Federal Employer Identification Number.
                    Now, you might be asking, why do we need an EIN? The EIN acts as your business&#39s Social Security
                    Number when filing for taxes. Your business is like an individual and needs to be identified by the
                    government for things like taxes and when dealing with employees. You also must have an FEIN for
                    applying for a business license. So, now that you know the purpose behind an FEIN, how can a small
                    business go about getting one? Let&#39s get started!
                </p>
                <p>
                    To start, go to the IRS site and look under information for new businesses. I will add the link in
                    the description below, but if you do a Google search for &#8220IRS.gov EIN Assistant&#8221, it will
                    also pop up. First, we need to follow the steps listed on the page. Step 1 simply confirms that your
                    business is located in the U.S. and that the person applying has a valid SSN available to use (that
                    is the Social Security Number). The second step reminds the user that the application must be done
                    in one session. Step 3 simply includes hitting the &#8220Apply Online Now&#8221 button to begin your
                    application!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once on this main page, you will want to read through the information given before beginning the
                    application. One thing to note is that you must complete this application in one sitting&#8211one
                    session like mentioned earlier, as that is less than 15 minutes. This application is very short and
                    should not take that long. You should also note that your EIN is available immediately after
                    applying. Once you&#39ve read and understood the information presented, which was also on the
                    previous page, we can begin the application!
                </p>
                <p>
                    To start the application, the EIN assistant asks what your business type is. From our previous
                    examples, we followed the Limited Liability Company, so we will do that again here. You should have
                    already filed with the SCC before trying to get your EIN, so you should know which legal structure
                    to follow for this step.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, the IRS site gives some information regarding the LLC business type to ensure that the reader
                    understands what it is that they are applying for. There are simple definitions and information that
                    we should already be aware of at this point to be applying for the FEIN, but the IRS is just making
                    sure and gives multiple changes to change your structure before you get too far into this process.
                    Once you feel comfortable knowing that you have chosen the right legal structure, you can hit
                    continue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, the site is asking for some basic information regarding the LLC. Fill in the box for how many
                    members are in the LLC. For our example, I am the only person, so I put a 1. Then you pick the state
                    in which the business is located. Again, after hitting the &#8220Continue&#8221 button, the IRS site
                    gives you more information regarding your choice to use the LLC legal structure and provides yet
                    another chance to return to choose a different one. If you have read the information and feel
                    confident in your LLC decision, you can hit continue and can move on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, the IRS wants to know why we need an EIN. For us, we are starting a new business and need it
                    for the operations of a small business. After picking the top button, hit continue.
                    Here, we need to fill out the information for who is responsible in the LLC. For our example, as the
                    only member of my LLC, I will put my own information in, including my SSN, and say that I am
                    one of the owners, members, or the managing member of this LLC. Make sure to double check this
                    information before moving forward again&#8211we don&#39t want any misspellings here!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moving on, we need to fill out the information for the physical location of the business. For our
                    example, I have an online business based out of my home. I will put my home address and home phone
                    number. Make sure to check if the address is different from where you want your mail to be sent to.
                    Since it&#39s my home address, this works fine. Again, double check this information for any errors
                    before moving forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, the EIN Assistant wants to know more about the LLC! You should have your legal name for the
                    LLC from filing with the SCC. If you decided to have a fictitious trade name, fill that in as well.
                    Fill in the information regarding the business&#39s location and the date that you filed with the
                    SCC will be used as the LLC start date. Double check the information, and then hit continue!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are almost there! The IRS wants to know even more about your business and, particularly, what
                    kind of business activities you will be performing. For our example, I answered no to all of the
                    questions—I do not have a huge commercial vehicle in use for my business, nor is my business
                    involving any gambling. I also do not need Form 720 for tax returns because my products and services
                    do not have excise taxes placed on them (these would include the sale of alcohol, cigarettes,
                    gasoline etc). This answer coincides with the next question, as well, and then I am the only one in
                    my LLC so I answer no to the last question regarding employees too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What&#39s the next part about? You guessed it! The IRS wants to know even more specifics about your
                    business and what you do! Pick from the list if applicable, but my example does not fit. For graphic
                    design services, I picked other and was prompted again to describe my services provided.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FINALLY! We made it! Our application went through and now we make the choice of where we want our
                    EIN confirmation letter sent. I chose to receive it online so that I could have it immediately. It
                    comes as a PDF and is easy to read. Once you&#39ve chosen, hit continue for the final time to
                    receive your Federal Employer Identification Number!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Congratulations! You now have your FEIN! You can use this to identify your business for tax purposes
                    and file for your business license. The process for filing for the EIN is not hard, and hopefully,
                    this tutorial made it even easier. Thank you for watching.

                <p>Hello! My name is Grace, and welcome to my tutorial on creating a free website for your business
                    using Wix. This website builder is simple and creates professional websites that can be used to
                    display your business&#39s uniqueness. This is such a simple process that will help your
                    business&#39s online presence stand out. Let&#39s get started!
                </p>
                <p> 
                    To begin, head over to wix.com. I have added the link to this slide, and I will link it in the
                    description below. Once on the site, click on the &#8220Get Started&#8221 button either at the top
                    of the page in the navigation bar or in the middle of the homepage. This is how you will create an
                    account and gain access to the Wix Website Development Software. You can use any email to sign or
                    continue with Google or Facebook for a quicker setup. Once you&#39ve created your account, you&#39re
                    ready to start building your business&#39s site!
                </p>
                <p>  
                    Once you have signed in, a page will load prompting you to create your first website using Wix. You
                    can click on the &#8220Create New Site&#8221 button to begin editing. This button will lead to a
                    prompt question helping you to decide what your site&#39s needs are. The question asks what type of
                    website you are creating, and here, you can choose if you want an online storefront or blog etc.
                    Then the site loads up your dashboard for your new site! For our example, we will be following the
                    online store website type.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Once on the dashboard, it&#39ll ask the name of your store along with some other questions to help
                    orient the creation of your website&#8211have you ever had an online store before? What would you
                    like to sell? Where would you like to sell it?. These questions will help the software by creating
                    pages that fit your needs and make the workload lighter for you! As you can see, Wix is a very
                    convenient online tool for website creation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After continuing to your dashboard, there will be a lot of options presented to you. What we need is
                    the &#8220design site&#8221 button in the top right&#8211hand corner. Once clicked, you will be
                    prompted with more questions about how you would like to design the website. You have the choice now
                    to pick from templates or you can allow Wix the control to create the site for you. Choose whichever
                    option is easiest for you, but both of these come with a lot of customizability.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    If you choose to pick from the Wix templates, there are many options to choose from that can be
                    better matched to what you want your base website to be for your needs. Simply find one that you
                    like and hit the &#8220View&#8221 or &#8220Edit&#8221 button that pops up when you hover over it.
                </p>
                <p>  
                    If you choose to let Wix create the site for you, you will be prompted yet again with another series
                    of questions to try and best match your base website to your business&#39s needs. Either way you
                    choose to go, the next step will be to edit your site!
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Finally, the fun part! Editing your site should be enjoyable and easy. The left item bar has many
                    elements that you can search through and add to your custom site. The site uses sections to split
                    things up, and you simply add pieces that you want to each section. The overall site design and
                    colors can also be edited in the site design tab as well as changing the overall theme. Once you
                    have created a site you like, you can preview it using the &#8220Preview&#8221 button in the upper
                    right&#8211hand corner. After that, if you are ready to go live with your site, you can publish it
                    using the blue &#8220Publish&#8221 button! This will give you the official link to your site, and
                    then you are ready to go! You can customize your domain as well, but that service is not free. Most
                    of the editing of your site will consist of moving items around and deciding what looks best where,
                    and just messing around with it. But that&#39s the fun part!
                </p>
                <p> 
                    As you can see, with the Wix Website Development Software, messing around with the design is fun and
                    easy and can help you bring attention to your business with a design that is as unique as your
                    business. I hope that you found this tutorial helpful and can consider Wix when building your small
                    business website. Thanks for watching!
